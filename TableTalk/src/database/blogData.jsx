    title: "Why Catan Still Reigns as the Gateway Game for New Players",
    content:
      "Settlers of Catan, now simply known as Catan, has stood the test of time as the go-to board game for introducing people to the hobby. Its blend of strategy, negotiation, and resource management makes it accessible yet deep. I still remember teaching it to my cousins last Christmas—they loved the social interaction and competitive spirit. Sure, some say it's outdated, but nothing beats that first race to 10 points!",

    title: "Top 5 Solo Board Games for When Your Friends Cancel",
    content:
      "Sometimes, you just want to play a game even if no one else is around. Thankfully, solo board gaming has grown massively. My favorites are: 1) Spirit Island, 2) Under Falling Skies, 3) Arkham Horror: The Card Game, 4) Friday, and 5) Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. These games provide a rich solo experience and scratch that strategic itch without feeling like you're 'just playing against the board.'",

    title: "The Beauty of Eurogames: No Dice, No Problem",
    content:
      "Eurogames are often dismissed for being too dry or lacking theme, but I find their mechanics-focused gameplay incredibly elegant. Games like Agricola, Terra Mystica, and Concordia showcase how decision-making and planning can shine without relying on randomness. Sure, you won’t get thrilling dice rolls, but you’ll get a deeply satisfying strategic experience.",

    title: "My Board Game Night Routine: From Setup to Cleanup",
    content:
      "Every Friday, we host a game night with a rotating group of friends. We start with snacks, vote on the game (usually between 3 picks), then dive into the setup. Lately, our go-to picks have been Cascadia, Everdell, and Azul. Cleanup is part of the ritual too—we divvy it up while sharing our favorite moments from the night. It’s more than just playing games—it’s our way to stay connected.",

    title: "Kickstarter Board Games: Are They Worth the Hype?",
    content:
      "I’ve backed over 20 Kickstarter games, and while some were worth every penny (like Frosthaven and ISS Vanguard), others were disappointing. The shiny stretch goals and deluxe components are tempting, but delays and unclear rulebooks can sour the experience. My advice? Only back if the gameplay looks solid and you’re ready for a wait.",
